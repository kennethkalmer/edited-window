# editing-window

As an admin of the (now deprecated) ZA Developers Slack Team, I was curious about the message editing behaviours of members in the team.

I also need to practice as much Clojure as I can so I thought this would be a simple Saturday experiment.

This isn't really useful to anyone other than myself, but it worked and did the job.

The biggest thing is that I had a chance to play with boot and compare it against my experience of using lein.

## Credits

I got the code for `(mean)`, `(median)` and reading the files from a directory from the [Clojure Cookbook](https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook).
